## Track 0: Orientation

### Summary

This initial track establishes the necessary context for the course. It clarifies the fundamental architectural shift introduced by The Merge, delineating the distinct roles of Execution Layer (`EL`) and Consensus Layer (`CL`) clients in the modern Ethereum ecosystem. Participants are guided on locating essential technical specifications, including the formal Ethereum Yellow Paper, the `EIP` repository, and client-specific documentation. The laboratory component involves executing a bootstrap script (`bootstrap/setup.sh`) designed to install the required Rust toolchain and system dependencies, followed by a sanity check to ensure the development environment is correctly configured for the subsequent hands-on tracks. This preparatory step is crucial, as it standardizes the environment across participants, mitigating potential setup issues in a course heavily reliant on code compilation and execution. Furthermore, the early emphasis on specification locations underscores the course's commitment to fostering "spec literacy" from the outset.

### Core Concepts

*   **Ethereum Client Architecture:** Post-Merge separation of concerns (`EL` vs. `CL`).
*   **The Merge:** Implications for client responsibilities and interaction.
*   **Ethereum Specification Landscape:** Role and location of the Yellow Paper, `EIPs`, Execution Layer Specifications, and Consensus Layer Specifications.
*   **Development Environment Setup:** Rust toolchain (`Cargo`, `rustc`), essential build dependencies (compilers, linkers).

### Laboratory Exercise

## Track 1: Ethereum Fundamentals

### Summary

This track delves into the foundational data structures and economic principles of Ethereum. It covers the distinction between Externally Owned Accounts (`EOAs`) and Contract Accounts, the structure and function of the Merkle Patricia Trie (`MPT`) which underpins Ethereum's state storage, and the concept of gas as the mechanism for metering computational resource usage. The associated lab, `mpt-play`, provides a practical Rust environment where participants programmatically construct Merkle Patricia Tries and verify proofs against them. This hands-on exercise solidifies understanding of how Ethereum manages and verifies its state, connecting the abstract `MPT` concept directly to code. Mastering `MPTs` is essential groundwork for comprehending state transitions, storage proofs used in light clients, and the internal workings of `EL` clients explored in later tracks (e.g., Track 4).

### Core Concepts

*   **Serialization:** Recursive Length Prefix (`RLP`) encoding for data structures.
*   **Gas Mechanism:** Purpose (preventing DoS, incentivizing efficiency), basic calculation principles.
*   **Proof Verification:** Concept of state proofs derived from `MPTs`.

### Laboratory Exercise

Utilize the `mpt-play` Rust crate (`modules/mpt-play/`) to build simple Merkle Patricia Tries, insert key-value pairs, generate proofs for specific keys, and verify these proofs programmatically. Run the example via `cargo run -p mpt-play --example simple_proof`.

## Track 2: EIP Bootcamp

### Summary

This track focuses on the process and substance of Ethereum protocol evolution. It covers the lifecycle of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (`EIPs`), the coordination mechanisms for network upgrades (hard forks) often specified via Meta `EIPs`, and the technical details of significant past and upcoming `EIPs` such as `EIP-1559` (reforming the transaction fee market), `EIP-4844` (introducing blob transactions for data availability, also known as Proto-Danksharding), and the EVM Object Format (`EOF`) initiative aimed at improving `EVM` structure and validation. The lab exercise involves using a purpose-built command-line tool, `eip-grep`, to search, analyze, and potentially compare different versions or sections of `EIP` specifications. This track directly targets the "Spec literacy" objective by equipping participants with the knowledge to navigate and understand the documents that define Ethereum's changes. Familiarity with recent and future `EIPs` like `EIP-4844` and `EOF` provides essential context for later tracks dealing with their implementation (Track 7) and the skills needed for eventual contribution (Track 10).

## Track 3: Opcode + VM

### Summary

This track provides a deep dive into the heart of Ethereum computation: the Ethereum Virtual Machine (`EVM`). It explains the `EVM`'s stack-based architecture, the role and function of individual opcodes (the `EVM`'s instruction set), the gas cost mechanism associated with each operation, and the utility of precompiled contracts for executing computationally intensive cryptographic functions efficiently. The lab requires participants to modify `revm`, a prominent and high-performance Rust implementation of the `EVM`, by adding a new, albeit simple, opcode. This exercise offers profound insight into the practical mechanics of `EVM` execution, moving beyond theoretical understanding to direct manipulation of a core component. Such experience is invaluable for debugging complex transaction issues, optimizing smart contract execution, and correctly implementing `EVM`-related `EIPs` (like the `EOF` changes discussed in Track 2). This practical grounding directly supports the "Protocol hacking" goal and is foundational for understanding transaction tracing (Track 4) and performance analysis (Track 8).

### Core Concepts

*   **`EVM` Architecture:** Stack machine principles, volatile Memory, persistent Storage, Program Counter.
*   **Opcodes:** Ethereum's instruction set (arithmetic, logical, stack, memory, storage, flow control, system operations).
*   **Gas Costs:** Static and dynamic gas calculation, gas schedule evolution across forks, `gasleft()`, `gasprice()`.
*   **Stack Operations:** `PUSH`, `POP`, `DUP`, `SWAP`.
*   **Memory Operations:** `MLOAD`, `MSTORE`, memory expansion costs.
*   **Storage Operations:** `SLOAD`, `SSTORE`, gas refunds.
*   **Control Flow:** `JUMP`, `JUMPI`, jump destinations, `STOP`, `RETURN`, `REVERT`.
*   **Precompiled Contracts:** Purpose (offloading heavy crypto), addresses, examples (`ecrecover`, `sha256`, `blake2f`, pairing checks).
*   **`EVM` Implementations:** Introduction to `revm` as a specific Rust implementation.

### Laboratory Exercise

Modify the `revm` codebase to introduce a new, custom opcode. This involves defining the opcode's behavior, its gas cost, and integrating it into the `EVM`'s execution loop/dispatch mechanism.

## Track 4: Reth tour I

### Summary

This track initiates the exploration of a specific, high-performance Execution Layer client: `Reth` (Rust Ethereum). The focus is on understanding its internal architecture, particularly how it manages persistent storage (state) and processes transactions through its execution pipeline. The laboratory exercise involves tracing the path of a single transaction within the `Reth` codebase, starting from its arrival at the `JSON-RPC` interface (e.g., via `eth_sendRawTransaction`), through validation in the transaction pool, execution by the `EVM` (likely using `revm`, studied in Track 3), and finally the state changes being committed to `Reth`'s underlying database (likely `MDBX`). This exercise is pivotal for developing the "Code traversal" skill. It bridges the gap between the theoretical Ethereum concepts (Accounts, `MPTs` from Track 1; `EVM` from Track 3) and their concrete implementation within a complex, production-grade software system. Successfully navigating the `Reth` codebase is a prerequisite for making meaningful contributions or modifications later in the course and beyond.

### Core Concepts

*   **`EL` Client Components:** High-level overview (`RPC` server, Transaction Pool, `EVM` integration, State Database interface, `P2P` networking layer).
*   **`Reth` Architecture:** Key crates/modules (e.g., `reth-rpc`, `reth-transaction-pool`, `reth-executor`, `reth-db`), design principles (modularity, performance).
*   **`JSON-RPC` API:** Standard Ethereum API, transaction submission endpoints.
*   **Transaction Pool (`TxPool`):** Role (pending/queued transactions), validation logic, nonce management, replacement policies.
*   **Execution Pipeline:** Stages involved in processing a block or transaction (validation, state transition, `EVM` execution, receipt generation).
*   **State Management:** Interaction between the execution layer and the database for reading state (e.g., account balances, storage) and writing updates (`MPT` modifications).
*   **Database Layer:** `Reth`'s use of `MDBX`, key-value storage concepts.
*   **Asynchronous Rust:** Use of `Tokio`, `async`/`await` patterns within `Reth` for concurrent operations.
*   **Code Navigation Tools:** Utilizing IDE features (go-to-definition, find references), debuggers, and code search for exploring large codebases.

### Laboratory Exercise

Using debugging tools and code navigation techniques, trace the execution flow of a sample transaction submitted via `JSON-RPC` through the relevant `Reth` modules (`RPC` handler, `Tx Pool`, Executor, DB commit).

## Track 5: Reth tour II

### Summary

Continuing the deep dive into `Reth`, this track shifts focus to its networking capabilities. It examines the `devp2p` protocol suite, which forms the foundation for peer-to-peer communication between Ethereum nodes, and explores `Reth`'s implementation of chain synchronization strategies, with a specific emphasis on Snap sync. The lab involves a practical modification to `Reth`'s networking layer: patching the logic used for scoring peers (a mechanism to prioritize connections with healthy, responsive nodes) and then testing the impact of this change. This exercise provides hands-on experience with a critical subsystem responsible for maintaining network connectivity and efficiently downloading blockchain data. Understanding networking and synchronization is vital not only for client developers but also for node operators concerned with performance and reliability. Modifying peer-scoring logic touches upon aspects of network security and resilience, broadening the participant's perspective on client operation and supporting the "Protocol hacking" goal.

### Core Concepts

*   **Peer-to-Peer (`P2P`) Networking:** Fundamental concepts (nodes, peers, discovery, gossip).
*   **`devp2p` Protocol Suite:** `RLPx` transport layer (encryption, authentication), node discovery protocols (`Discv4`, potentially `Discv5`).
*   **Ethereum Wire Protocol:** Sub-protocols (`eth` for block/tx exchange, `snap` for state sync).
*   **Node Discovery:** How nodes find each other on the network.
*   **Connection Management:** Establishing and maintaining peer connections.
*   **Blockchain Sync Strategies:** Overview (Full Sync, Fast Sync, Snap Sync, Light Sync), trade-offs.
*   **Snap Sync:** Mechanism (downloading state snapshots rather than replaying transactions), advantages.
*   **Peer Management:** Peer scoring algorithms, reputation systems, banning/disconnection logic.
*   **Network Protocol Testing:** Strategies for testing changes in `P2P` behavior.

### Laboratory Exercise

Locate and modify the peer-scoring implementation within `Reth`'s networking code. Implement a specific change (e.g., adjusting penalties for certain behaviors) and devise a way to test its effect, potentially in a simulated or private network environment.

## Track 6: Consensus bridge

### Summary

This track addresses the critical interaction point established by The Merge: the interface between the Execution Layer (`EL`) client (`Reth`) and a Consensus Layer (`CL`) client. It focuses on the Engine API, the standardized `RPC` specification governing their communication, and touches upon the concept of the fork-choice rule, which the `CL` uses to determine the canonical chain head. The laboratory exercise involves constructing a minimal `CL` "stub" – a simplified program that simulates the role of a `CL` client by sending Engine API commands to `Reth`, thereby driving its block processing and state updates. Understanding the Engine API is indispensable for developers working on either `EL` or `CL` clients, as it dictates how blocks are proposed, validated, and finalized in the post-Merge era. Building a `CL` stub provides direct, practical experience with the API's methods (like `engine_newPayloadV3`, `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV3`) and the data flow between the two client types, solidifying comprehension of this fundamental architectural relationship.

### Core Concepts

*   **Post-Merge Architecture Review:** Reinforcing `EL` and `CL` roles and responsibilities.
*   **Engine API:** Purpose, specification location (`execution-apis` repository), key methods (payload execution, fork choice updates, transition configuration).
*   **Fork-Choice Rule:** High-level understanding of its purpose (selecting the canonical chain), LMD-GHOST as the current algorithm (conceptual).
*   **Payload Building:** How the `EL` constructs execution payloads (blocks) under the direction of the `CL`.
*   **Communication Flow:** Sequence of Engine API calls during normal operation (new block proposal, validation, finalization).
*   **Client Simulation:** Techniques for creating minimal stubs to interact with standard APIs.

### Laboratory Exercise

Develop a simple Rust application that acts as a minimal `CL` client. This stub should connect to `Reth`'s Engine API endpoint and send basic commands (e.g., `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV3` to update the head, `engine_newPayloadV3` to provide a new block for execution) and process the responses.

## Track 7: Modern upgrades

### Summary

This track focuses on integrating recent and significant Ethereum protocol upgrades into the client implementation. It specifically targets the changes introduced by the Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) upgrade, primarily `EIP-4844` (Proto-Danksharding), which introduced blob-carrying transactions. It may also touch upon ongoing work like the EVM Object Format (`EOF`) and preparations for future upgrades like Verkle Tries. The laboratory exercise involves implementing the logic required to decode the new blob transaction type within the context of the `Reth` client. This track ensures the course remains current by engaging with cutting-edge protocol developments. Implementing parts of a major `EIP` like `EIP-4844` provides direct experience with the complexities of adapting client software to substantial protocol changes, a core competency for `EL` developers. It requires understanding the new data structures, serialization formats, and validation rules, building upon the `EIP` knowledge from Track 2 and the client architecture understanding from Tracks 4 and 5. This practical application directly supports the "Protocol hacking" goal.

### Core Concepts

*   **`EIP-4844` Deep Dive:** Blob transaction structure (type 3 tx), `blob_versioned_hashes`, maximum blobs per block, KZG commitments, interaction with the beacon chain for blob data, point evaluation precompile (`POINT_EVALUATION`).
*   **Data Availability:** How `EIP-4844` improves data availability for rollups (conceptual).
*   **Transaction Pool Modifications:** Handling blob transactions, new validation rules.
*   **Execution Layer Changes:** Integration of blob gas fee (`EIP-7516`), new fields in block headers, changes to payload validation.
*   **`EOF` Concepts (if covered):** Detailed structure, validation rules, potential impact on `EVM` execution.
*   **Verkle Tries Concepts (if covered):** Motivation (statelessness, smaller proofs), basic structural differences from `MPTs`.
*   **Serialization/Deserialization:** Handling new `RLP`-encoded structures for blob transactions.

### Laboratory Exercise

Within the `Reth` codebase (potentially guided by `reth-patches`), implement the necessary Rust code to correctly deserialize and potentially perform basic validation on `EIP-4844` blob transactions.

## Track 8: Performance

### Summary

This track addresses the critical non-functional requirement of performance in Ethereum clients. It introduces techniques for analyzing client behavior and identifying bottlenecks, prominently featuring the use of flamegraphs for visualizing CPU usage. It also covers strategies for managing state growth, such as state pruning. The lab exercise involves modifying `Reth` to add a command-line flag (`--flame`) that enables the generation of flamegraphs, likely by integrating a profiling library like `pprof` or `cargo-flamegraph`. Performance engineering is essential for maintaining a healthy network and providing a good user experience for node operators and dApp users. Equipping developers with profiling skills allows them to diagnose performance regressions, optimize critical code paths, and make informed decisions about resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O). Adding instrumentation like a flamegraph flag directly contributes to the "DevOps confidence" goal by providing tools for operational analysis. This track leverages the understanding of `Reth`'s execution pipeline gained in Track 4.

### Core Concepts

*   **Software Profiling:** Concepts (sampling vs. instrumentation), common tools (`perf`, `Valgrind`, language-specific profilers).
*   **Flamegraphs:** How they are generated (stack sampling), how to read them (width represents time spent, vertical axis represents stack depth), identifying performance hotspots.
*   **Client Bottlenecks:** Common areas impacting performance (database access, `EVM` execution, `P2P` message handling, cryptography).
*   **State Pruning:** Motivation (controlling disk usage), different pruning strategies (e.g., distance-based), implications for historical data access.
*   **Benchmarking:** Designing and running effective benchmarks, avoiding common pitfalls.
*   **Rust Performance:** Common optimization techniques in Rust, understanding compiler optimizations, memory management considerations.

## Track 9: Security testing

### Summary

This track focuses on methodologies for ensuring the correctness and security of Ethereum client software, particularly critical components like the `EVM`. It introduces advanced testing techniques beyond standard unit and integration tests, such as defining and verifying state invariants (properties that must always hold true) and differential fuzzing. Differential fuzzing involves comparing the output of two different implementations (e.g., two `EVM` implementations) using the same randomly generated inputs to detect discrepancies, which often indicate subtle bugs. The lab involves building a differential fuzzer that pits `revm` (the Rust `EVM` explored in Track 3) against `evmone`, a widely used C++ `EVM` implementation. Given the adversarial environment and high value secured by Ethereum, rigorous testing is non-negotiable. This track provides exposure to powerful techniques used by core developers and security researchers to uncover vulnerabilities and consensus bugs. Building a differential fuzzer offers direct experience with a state-of-the-art bug-finding approach applicable to complex systems like `EVMs`.

### Core Concepts

*   **Software Testing Paradigms:** Review of unit, integration, end-to-end testing in the context of blockchain clients.
*   **Invariant Testing:** Defining properties of the system state or execution that should never be violated, implementing checks for these invariants.
*   **Fuzz Testing (Fuzzing):** Concept (automated random input generation), types (dumb, coverage-guided, grammar-based), goals (finding crashes, assertion failures, unexpected behavior).
*   **Differential Fuzzing:** Principle (comparing N implementations), application to `EVMs`, identifying consensus bugs.
*   **`EVM` Test Formats:** Familiarity with existing test suites (e.g., Ethereum Tests repository) used for consensus testing.
*   **Ethereum Execution Spec Tests (`EEST`):** A newer collection and framework for generating tests focused on verifying implementations against `ethereum/execution-specs`, particularly for recent/upcoming changes. Complements the main `ethereum/tests` repository.
*   **Client/VM Vulnerabilities:** Common bug classes (e.g., incorrect gas calculation, state inconsistencies, denial-of-service vectors).
*   **Rust Fuzzing Ecosystem:** Tools like `cargo-fuzz` (using `libFuzzer`) or custom fuzzing harnesses.
*   **`evmone`:** Introduction to the `evmone` C++ `EVM` implementation as a reference point.

### Laboratory Exercise

Develop a Rust application (`fuzz-differ`) that takes `EVM` bytecode (potentially generated or mutated) as input, executes it on both `revm` and `evmone` (likely via FFI or bindings), and compares the resulting state changes, gas used, and output. Report any discrepancies found.

## Track 10: Governance

### Summary

The final instructional track shifts focus from purely technical implementation to the socio-technical aspects of Ethereum core development. It covers the unwritten rules and established processes governing protocol changes, including `EIP` authoring etiquette (how to effectively propose, justify, and specify changes), the typical release cycle for client software, and norms for constructive interaction within the core developer community (e.g., AllCoreDevs calls, Ethereum Magicians forum). The lab exercise involves drafting a Meta `EIP`. Unlike standard `EIPs` proposing protocol changes, Meta `EIPs` typically document processes, guidelines, or information related to Ethereum development itself. This exercise provides practical experience in structuring a formal proposal according to `EIP-1` standards and communicating technical or process-related ideas clearly within the established governance framework. This track directly addresses the "Community chops" goal, preparing participants to engage effectively in the collaborative, open-source environment where Ethereum evolves. It synthesizes the technical knowledge gained throughout the course with the procedural understanding needed to contribute meaningfully.

### Core Concepts

*   **Ethereum Governance Model:** Role of Core Developers, AllCoreDevs (`ACD`) calls, `EIP` process, community input channels (EthMagicians, Discord).
*   **`EIP` Authoring:** Best practices (clear motivation/rationale, precise specification, backwards compatibility considerations, test cases), adhering to the `EIP-1` template.
*   **Community Interaction:** Engaging in discussions, responding to feedback constructively, building consensus.
*   **Client Release Management:** Coordination between client teams, testing phases (devnets, testnets), versioning schemes, release notes.
*   **Open Source Contribution Workflow:** Standard practices (forking, branching, pull requests, code reviews) as applied to Ethereum clients.
*   **Meta `EIPs`:** Purpose and examples (e.g., `EIPs` defining hard fork contents or processes).

### Laboratory Exercise

Draft a simple Meta `EIP`. This could involve documenting a potential improvement to the `EIP` process itself, outlining guidelines for a specific type of contribution, or summarizing information relevant to developers (choosing a suitable, constrained topic is key). Adhere to the formatting and structure specified in `EIP-1`.

## V. Conclusion

The "EVM Zero → Hero" curriculum, as outlined in this syllabus, represents a rigorous and comprehensive pathway for experienced Rust developers to gain the specialized knowledge required for Ethereum core development. Its structure logically progresses from foundational concepts (Ethereum data structures, `EVM` mechanics, `EIP` process) through the intricacies of a modern Execution Layer client (`Reth` architecture, networking, consensus interface) to advanced topics such as protocol upgrades, performance analysis, security testing, and governance participation.

The strong emphasis on hands-on laboratory exercises, conducted entirely in Rust and often involving direct interaction with or modification of production-grade codebases like `Reth` and `revm`, ensures that theoretical knowledge is consistently paired with practical application. The deliberate focus on "spec literacy," "code traversal," and "protocol hacking" directly targets the core competencies needed to contribute effectively. By completing this curriculum, participants will be well-equipped not only to understand the inner workings of Ethereum's Execution Layer but also to analyze, modify, instrument, and ultimately contribute to the ongoing development and evolution of clients like `Reth` and the protocol itself. The provision of curated research links for each track further supports both independent learning and structured instruction based on this syllabus.
