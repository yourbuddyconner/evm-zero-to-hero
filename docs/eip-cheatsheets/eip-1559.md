# EIP-1559 Cheat Sheet: Fee Market Change

## What Is It?
EIP-1559 introduced a major change to Ethereum's fee market mechanism, replacing the simple first-price auction with a base fee that gets burned and a priority fee that goes to miners/validators.

## Key Concepts

### Fee Structure
- **Base Fee**: Algorithmically determined, burned (not paid to miners/validators)
  - Adjusts up or down by up to 12.5% per block
  - Target: 50% full blocks (15M gas)
  - Increases when blocks are consistently above target
  - Decreases when blocks are consistently below target
- **Priority Fee (Tip)**: User-specified maximum value, paid to block producers
- **Max Fee**: User-specified maximum total fee willing to pay (base fee + priority fee)

### Transaction Fields
- **max_priority_fee_per_gas**: Maximum tip per gas (replaces legacy gas price)
- **max_fee_per_gas**: Maximum total fee per gas (must be ≥ max_priority_fee_per_gas)
- Final tip paid = min(max_priority_fee_per_gas, max_fee_per_gas - base_fee_per_gas)

### Block Structure Changes
- **Block Header Changes**:
  - Added `base_fee_per_gas` (uint256)
  - Increased gas limit to 30M (but with 15M target)
- **Block Gas Target**: 15M gas (50% full)
- **Block Gas Limit**: 30M gas (allows for temporary demand spikes)

## Benefits

- **Fee Predictability**: More stable transaction fees over time
- **Faster Inclusion**: Reduced wait times for transaction confirmation
- **Reduced Overpayment**: Users no longer need to drastically overpay during congestion
- **ETH Deflationary Mechanism**: Base fee is burned, reducing ETH supply over time
- **Mitigates MEV Impact**: Reduces incentives for certain types of block manipulation

## Implementation Notes

### Transaction Type
- New transaction type (EIP-2718 Type 2)
- Legacy transaction format still supported (converted to Type 2 with priority fee = gas price)

### Fee Calculation Example
```
base_fee_per_gas = 100 gwei
max_fee_per_gas = 150 gwei
max_priority_fee_per_gas = 10 gwei

Effective priority fee = min(10, 150-100) = 10 gwei
Total fee paid = (100 + 10) gwei × gas_used
Amount burned = 100 gwei × gas_used
Amount to miner = 10 gwei × gas_used
```

### Important Edge Cases
- If `base_fee` > `max_fee_per_gas`, transaction is invalid
- If block is empty, base fee decreases by maximum amount (12.5%)
- If block is full, base fee increases by maximum amount (12.5%)
- Validators may still include transactions out of priority fee order for various reasons

## Historical Context
- **Proposed**: 2019 by Vitalik Buterin
- **Implemented**: August 5, 2021 (London Hard Fork)
- **Follow-ups**: EIP-4844 builds on some concepts from EIP-1559 for blob fee markets
