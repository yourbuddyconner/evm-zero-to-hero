# EIP-4844 Cheat Sheet: Proto-Danksharding

## What Is It?
EIP-4844 introduced blob transactions (also known as proto-danksharding) to Ethereum, providing a new transaction type that includes "blobs" of data. These blobs are cheaper to publish but are only temporarily available, making them ideal for Layer 2 rollups to post their data commitments.

## Key Concepts

### Blob Transactions
- **New Transaction Type**: EIP-2718 transaction type 3
- **Purpose**: Significantly reduce costs for rollups by providing temporary data availability
- **Data Structure**: Each transaction can contain up to 2 blobs of data (each blob is ~125 KB)
- **Availability**: Blobs are available on the p2p network for ~18 days (archive nodes may keep them longer)
- **Gas Calculation**: Blob gas is separate from execution gas and has its own fee market

### Technical Components

#### Blob Data Structure
- **Size**: Each blob contains 4096 field elements (~125 KB)
- **Encoding**: Uses KZG polynomial commitments (based on BLS12-381 curve)
- **Versioned Hash**: Each blob is referenced by a versioned hash in the transaction
- **Verification**: Uses KZG proofs to verify inclusion of specific points in the blob

#### New Transaction Fields
- **blob_versioned_hashes**: Array of commitment versioned hashes
- **max_fee_per_blob_gas**: Maximum fee per blob gas unit the sender is willing to pay
- **blob_gas**: Amount of blob gas used by the transaction (currently 131,072 per blob)

### Fee Market
- **Separate Fee Market**: Blobs have their own fee market distinct from execution gas
- **Target Size**: 3 blobs per block (~375 KB)
- **Adjustment Mechanism**: Similar to EIP-1559, with exponential adjustment based on usage
- **Blob Base Fee Calculation**: Uses EIP-1559-style adjustment but with different parameters
- **Min Base Fee**: 1 wei per blob gas
- **Adjustment Rate**: Can change up to 3.75x or down to 0.5x per epoch (6.4 minutes)

## Implementation Details

### Block Structure Changes
- **New Fields in Block Header**:
  - `blob_gas_used`: Total blob gas used in a block
  - `excess_blob_gas`: Accumulator tracking recent blob gas usage
  - `parent_beacon_block_root`: Root of the parent beacon block

### New EVM Opcode
- **BLOBHASH (0x49)**: Returns the versioned hash of a blob at a given index
  - Takes one argument: blob index
  - Returns the 32-byte versioned hash
  - Reverts if index is invalid

### Consensus Layer Changes
- **Beacon Block Body**: Extended to include blob data and KZG commitments
- **Data Availability**: Blobs are stored in a separate "sidecar" of the beacon block
- **Networking**: New p2p protocol for blob data transmission

## Benefits
- **Reduced L2 Costs**: ~10-100x reduction in data posting costs for rollups
- **Scalability**: Enables much higher throughput for Ethereum's rollup-centric roadmap
- **Future Compatibility**: Prepares for full Danksharding in the future
- **Separates Concerns**: Data availability priced separately from execution

## Historical Context
- **Proposed**: February 2022
- **Implemented**: March 2024 (Cancun/Dencun upgrade)
- **Part of Ethereum's Rollup-Centric Roadmap**: Stepping stone to full Danksharding

## Important Limitations
- **Not for Contract Storage**: Blob data cannot be accessed by smart contracts
- **Temporary Availability**: Data is only guaranteed to be available for ~18 days
- **Limited Blob Count**: Initially limited to 6 blobs per block (can be increased later)
- **Minimum Size**: Always charged for full blob even if partially used
